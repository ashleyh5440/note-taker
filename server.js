// GIVEN a note-taking application
// WHEN I open the Note Taker
// THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
// WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
// THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
// WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
// THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
// WHEN I click on the Save button
// THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
// WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
// THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
// WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
// THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears

// The following HTML routes should be created:

// GET /notes should return the notes.html file.

// GET * should return the index.html file.

// The following API routes should be created:

// GET /api/notes should read the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON.

// POST /api/notes should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the db.json file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).

// DELETE /api/notes/:id should receive a query parameter that contains the id of a note to delete. To delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the db.json file, remove the note with the given id property, and then rewrite the notes to the db.json file.
